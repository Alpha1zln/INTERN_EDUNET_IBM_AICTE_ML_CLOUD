# CREDIT DEFAULT PREDICTION

# This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers' default payments in Taiwan. 
# From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable 
# than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. 

# We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments.
